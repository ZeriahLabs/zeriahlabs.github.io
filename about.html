    <h1>Zeriah Labs</h1>
    <p>
      Zeriah Labs was created with a simple idea: to provide quality, educational, and enjoyable content for kids.
      Instead of endless videos or cartoons, we design experiences that are engaging, cute, and meaningful —
      something that entertains while helping children learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As parents, we place privacy and security at the center of everything we build. Fun and learning come next,
      supported by tools that give parents helpful feedback along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create apps that are safe, educational, and delightful —
      evolving over time to meet the needs of families while staying rooted in care and trust.
