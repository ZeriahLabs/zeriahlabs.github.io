    <h1>About Zeriah Labs</h1>
    <p>Zeriah Labs was founded out of a personal need as a parent. When my child and I were on the go, I wanted an alternative to endless YouTube videos and cartoons—something that could be engaging, delightful, and above all, educational. That vision became the foundation of Zeriah Labs.</p>
    <p>At our core, we prioritize <strong>privacy and security</strong>. As a parent, I understand how important it is to protect children’s data and experiences online. That’s why our apps are designed with privacy as the first principle. Around this foundation, we build experiences that are fun, interactive, and educational, while also offering parents meaningful insights and feedback.</p>
    <p>We believe that great products evolve through collaboration. Instead of a “take it or leave it” approach, Zeriah Labs is committed to listening to our community. Your feedback plays a vital role in shaping our tools, and we do our best to incorporate suggestions into future updates—making the apps better for both children and parents over time.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting Zeriah Labs and supporting our journey. These little tools are created with love for little ones, and we hope they bring both joy and learning to your family.</p>
